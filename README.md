## üèÜ Impact & Results

With this project, we...
- **reduced sign-in time by 90%** by overhauling a manual Google Sheets process
- **built a fully automated** CI/CD pipeline with zero-downtime deployments
- focused on the details by establishing **production-grade** infrastructure enhancing developer experience
- developed in a **multi-language** ecosystem to become better developers!
- won the award for **UBCEA's Best Internal Department**

<!-- ### Key Applications

| Repository | Technology | Purpose | Impact |
|------------|------------|---------|---------|
| **[lounge-hub](https://github.com/ubcesports/lounge-hub)** | TypeScript | Primary gaming lounge management application | 90% faster check-ins |
| **[lounge-portal](https://github.com/ubcesports/lounge-portal)** | Go | Member-facing portal for lounge information | Enhanced user experience |
| **[sched](https://github.com/ubcesports/sched)** | Rust | Executive shift scheduling system | Automated workforce management |
| **[echo-base](https://github.com/ubcesports/echo-base)** | Backend API | Core backend services | Centralized data management | -->

## üé® Design Philosophy

Our design approach focused on creating an intuitive, modular interface that prioritizes usability for our team. Taking inspiration from the Tesla Model 3's clean, functional UI, we developed a system where each section controls distinct functionality while maintaining visual cohesion.

### **Design Principles**
- **Modular Interface**: Each UI section has clear, distinct functionality - just like the Tesla Model 3's segmented control areas
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Self-explanatory layout that requires minimal onboarding for new executives
- **Keyboard-First**: Full keyboard navigation support for power users and accessibility
- **Functional Aesthetics**: Clean, distraction-free design that enhances workflow efficiency

### **Tesla Model 3 Inspiration**
We drew heavily from Tesla's approach to dashboard design, where every element serves a purpose and complex functionality is organized into digestible, modular sections.

### **Key Design Decisions**
- **Consistent Visual Language**: Unified color scheme and typography across all modules
- **Consistent, Scalable Map**: The interactive desk map is the core of our app, and reflects the real layout in our lounge
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features are accessible but don't clutter the primary interface
- **User-Centric Flow**: Designed based on actual executive workflows and pain points from the previous manual system

## üõ† Technical Architecture

Below are languages, components, design decisions, and infrastructure we've set up for our project.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, React, containerized development environment
- **Backend**: Node.js, PostgreSQL, RESTful API architecture
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Nginx reverse proxy, AWS EC2
- **Additional Services (outside lounge-hub)**: Go microservices, Rust scheduling system

### DevOps & CI/CD Pipeline
Our custom-built CI/CD pipeline demonstrates enterprise-level engineering practices. For more information, [we wrote this article](https://medium.com/@jadenhums51/building-a-custom-ci-cd-pipeline-from-scratch-for-a-university-gaming-club-083b57b4ea9c)!

### **Automated Testing & Quality Assurance**
- **Unit Testing**: Mocha and Jest test suites with mandatory PR validation
- **Code Quality**: ESLint integration with blocking requirements
- **Environment Consistency**: Docker containerization across development and production

### **Deployment Infrastructure**
- **Cloud Hosting**: AWS EC2 with automated image management via ECR
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx configuration for HTTPS and request routing
- **Security**: Let's Encrypt SSL certificates with automatic renewal
- **Monitoring**: AWS Systems Manager for deployment status tracking

### **Release Process**

    D --> E[Docker Build]
    E --> F[ECR Push]
    F --> G[EC2 Deployment]
    G --> H[Live Production]
```

**Deployment Speed**: ~90 seconds from merge to production

## üíº Professional Highlights

Alongside how we've grown technically, we've developed several soft skills working together in a software development team.

<!-- ### **Enterprise-Grade Practices**
- **Microservices Architecture**: We're exploring multi-language services with clear separation of concerns
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Dockerized environments with production parity
- **Automated Quality Gates**: Comprehensive testing and linting requirements
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Rolling updates with health checks -->

### **Technical Leadership**
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Led software development team while actively supporting club operations, socials, and events
- **Stakeholder Management**: Delivered measurable improvements to executive workflows
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive technical documentation and knowledge sharing

### **Innovation & Problem Solving**
- **Custom Solutions**: Built tailored CI/CD pipeline instead of using off-the-shelf tools, diverting budget towards providing quality events
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieved 90% performance improvement in core user flows
- **Scalability**: Designed systems to handle growing university gaming community

- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch integration

## üìä Technical Achievements

For our team, we're all UBC students looking to grow, build our technical toolkit, and build value with tech! Here's a snapshot of what we've learned through building this app:

- **Multi-Language Proficiency**: We successfully deployed our TypeScript app, and working on a new app with Go
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: We gained hands-on AWS experience with EC2, ECR, and Systems Manager
- **DevOps Automation**: We banded together to create a custom CI/CD pipeline reducing deployment friction
- **Security Implementation**: We learned about security practices like HTTPS, SSL certificates, and API Authentication
