## üèÜ Impact & Results

With this project, we...
- **reduced sign-in time by 90%** by overhauling a manual Google Sheets process
- **built a fully automated** CI/CD pipeline with zero-downtime deployments
- focused on the details by establishing **production-grade** infrastructure enhancing developer experience
- developed in a **multi-language** ecosystem to become better developers!
- won the award for **UBCEA's Best Internal Department**

<!-- ### Key Applications

| Repository | Technology | Purpose | Impact |
|------------|------------|---------|---------|
| **[lounge-hub](https://github.com/ubcesports/lounge-hub)** | TypeScript | Primary gaming lounge management application | 90% faster check-ins |
| **[lounge-portal](https://github.com/ubcesports/lounge-portal)** | Go | Member-facing portal for lounge information | Enhanced user experience |
| **[sched](https://github.com/ubcesports/sched)** | Rust | Executive shift scheduling system | Automated workforce management |
| **[echo-base](https://github.com/ubcesports/echo-base)** | Backend API | Core backend services | Centralized data management | -->

## üõ† Technical Architecture

Below are languages, components, design decisions, and infrastructure we've set up for our project.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, React, containerized development environment
- **Backend**: Node.js, PostgreSQL, RESTful API architecture
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Nginx reverse proxy, AWS EC2
- **Additional Services (outside lounge-hub)**: Go microservices, Rust scheduling system

### DevOps & CI/CD Pipeline
Our custom-built CI/CD pipeline demonstrates enterprise-level engineering practices. For more information, [we wrote this article](https://medium.com/@jadenhums51/building-a-custom-ci-cd-pipeline-from-scratch-for-a-university-gaming-club-083b57b4ea9c)!

#### **Automated Testing & Quality Assurance**
- **Unit Testing**: Mocha and Jest test suites with mandatory PR validation
- **Code Quality**: ESLint integration with blocking requirements
- **Environment Consistency**: Docker containerization across development and production

#### **Deployment Infrastructure**
- **Cloud Hosting**: AWS EC2 with automated image management via ECR
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx configuration for HTTPS and request routing
- **Security**: Let's Encrypt SSL certificates with automatic renewal
- **Monitoring**: AWS Systems Manager for deployment status tracking

#### **Release Process**

```

**Deployment Speed**: ~90 seconds from merge to production

## üíº Professional Highlights

Alongside how we've grown technically, we've developed several soft skills working together in a software development team.

<!-- ### **Enterprise-Grade Practices**
- **Microservices Architecture**: We're exploring ulti-language services with clear separation of concerns
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Dockerized environments with production parity
- **Automated Quality Gates**: Comprehensive testing and linting requirements
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Rolling updates with health checks -->

### **Technical Leadership**
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Led software development team while actively supporting club operations, socials, and events
- **Stakeholder Management**: Delivered measurable improvements to executive workflows
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive technical documentation and knowledge sharing

### **Innovation & Problem Solving**
- **Custom Solutions**: Built tailored CI/CD pipeline instead of using off-the-shelf tools
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieved 90% performance improvement in core user flows
- **Scalability**: Designed systems to handle growing university gaming community

## üîß Development Experience

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Clone and start development environment
git clone https://github.com/ubcesports/lounge-hub
cd lounge-hub
docker-compose up

# Run tests and linting
npm test
npm run lint
```

### Production Architecture
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker Compose orchestration
- **Load Balancing**: Nginx reverse proxy with SSL termination
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with persistent storage
- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch integration

## üìä Technical Achievements

For our team, we're all UBC students looking to grow, build our technical toolkit, and build value with tech! Here's a snapshot of what we've learned through building this app:

- **Multi-Language Proficiency**: We successfully deployed our TypeScript app, and working on a new app with Go
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: We gained hands-on AWS experience with EC2, ECR, and Systems Manager
- **DevOps Automation**: We banded together to create a custom CI/CD pipeline reducing deployment friction
- **Security Implementation**: We learned about security practices like HTTPS, SSL certificates, and API Authentication
