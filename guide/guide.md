## UBCEA Lounge App Official Documentation

### Introduction
Welcome to the lounge app! This is the official guide to help you get started and make the most out of our computer lounge system.

### Getting Started
**Logging in**: During the opening shift, sign into the Lounge App using the credentials found in the Notion at [TODO](fill in where we keep the credentials). If you are unsure where to find this, feel free to ask in the `#development` chat on slack.
**Logging out**: It is important that we remember to log out of the Lounge App when the lounge closes. To do this, simply click the 'Log out' button in the top left of the screen.

### User Sign Up
1. If a user doesn't already have a membership, direct them to our [Showpass](https://www.showpass.com/ubcea-membership2425/) and ask them to purchase a membership, then proceed to step 2.
2. Verify that the user has purchased a membership on our end by searching for their name in the Showpass. If they paid 15 dollars, they bought a tier 1 membership. If they paid 25 dollars, they bought a tier 2 membership.
3. Ask for the user's student id card.
4. In the 'Add Profile' box at the top right of the screen (if it says Check In, click the green 'Add New' to switch to the sign-up form), enter in the student's information.
5. This form can also be used to update a student's information based on their student number. For example, if you want to add some notes to a student's profile, you can fill in their student number, name, and add some notes about them.
6. Follow the [User Check In](#user-check-in) steps to check them in.

### User Check In
**Notes**: If a user has a tier 1 membership, the Lounge App will warn you if they are signing in more than once a day. It is up to your discretion if you allow them to continue or not.

1. Ask the user if they have a membership with UBCEA - if they don't, direct them to our [Showpass](https://www.showpass.com/ubcea-membership2425/) and ask them to purchase a membership, then proceed to User Sign Up instructions above. If they do have a membership, move on to step 2.
2. Ask for the user's student id card, the game that they intend on playing and if they have a preference on which PC they play on (If none or if you decide to, you may assign them a PC of your choosing). If they are not a UBC student and do not have a student id, enter `11111111` for the student number.
3. In the 'Check in' box at the top right of the screen (if it says Add Profile, click the green 'Check In' to switch to the check-in form), enter in the student's information. Make sure there are no spaces and that the student number is correct. For the game, **please enter in the full title of the game** (e.g. League of Legends, not LOL or League). If it is a common game, you can click on the suggested game.
4. Press 'Check in' and the corresponding PC should update on the Lounge Map. Right below the check-in box, there should be some information about the user you just checked in, including their student number, name, membership level and notes.
5. If there is an error with check-in, verify that the user has a membership on our Showpass and follow the [User Sign Up](#user-sign-up) instructions to add their membership to our database.
6. Place the user's student id card into our alphabetically sorted folder-pouch thing.

### User Sign Out
1. To sign a user out, click on their PC, **fill in your full name**, and click 'Check out'.
